# libinterflux

Universal Data Interchange and System Abstraction Library.

## Overview

`libinterflux` is a C library designed to provide a unified, safe, and efficient way to handle data serialization and system abstraction across different programming languages and platforms. It is inspired by the simplicity and versatility of SQLite but focuses on data interchange and system interfaces.

The core features include:
- **Language-independent serialization** with support for dynamic schemas
- **System abstraction** for I/O, networking, and timers with async support and WASI compatibility
- **Deterministic execution** for real-time and critical systems
- **Safety**: Built-in static analysis and memory bounds checking
- **Bindings**: Auto-generated bindings for Python, Rust, Go, and JavaScript

### Prerequisites

- A C compiler (GCC, Clang, or MSVC)
- CMake (version 3.10 or higher)
- Git

## Status

 **Under Active Development**
